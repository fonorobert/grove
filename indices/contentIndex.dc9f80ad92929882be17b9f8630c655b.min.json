Meetings should be about getting people together to talk through a disagreement, make decisions, plan together or talk through existing plans. That last one is especially important, having a \"do we still agree?\" meeting is a great way to surface concerns before it's too late. \n\n## Key elements of a good meeting\n\n### Goals - what are we even doing here?\n\nWhy are we having this meeting? What are we trying to accomplish? This is also a great point to decide whether a meeting is the right tool to accomplish this goal. Could this be done over Slack or email instead?\n\n### Agenda - like, have one!\n\nWhat topics are we going to discuss? A simple list is fine, the point is to let everyone prepare. Agendas are great for keeping a meeting on track as well. Is what we're talking about on the agenda? If not, should it be, or should we just get back on topic?\nYou should share the agenda **before** the meeting. Some of the worst meetings happen because nobody knew what they were showing up to discuss.\n\n### Notes - take'em, share'em!\n\nTake notes. Simple, isn't it? You may find this difficult, maybe you're trying to write down every turn of the discussion, that can certainly be too much. You can start by focusing on just the outcomes however, after all this is the important bit to remember later. What did we agree on? What did we decide? What conclusions did we come to?\n\nOne more thing: **share your notes** after the meeting. Every participant should receive a meeting log of some sort. Yes they may have taken their own notes, but this way there is a shared set of notes that everyone sees and can refer back to.\n\nYou can also share notes with stakeholders that you'd otherwise invite to the meeting. If they'd just be there to \"stay in the loop\", a set of notes is a better way to keep them up-to-date.\n\n\n## Rules for a good meeting\n\nAt the very minimum keep yourself to these rules and you'll be 80% of the way to having good meetings.\n\n### No agenda - no meeting!\n\nIf you don't know beforehand what you'll be talking about, you're not ready to talk yet. \"Figuring out what we should talk about\" is a perfectly valid meeting topic. Once you've figured that out, you can schedule a new meeting for discussing the topics you came up with.\n*Warning: don't let the \"come up with topics\" meeting turn into a \"discuss topics\" meeting. Let yourself and others prepare.*\n\nIf by the time the meeting is supposed to start you still didn't or couldn't share an agenda with participants, simply cancel the meeting$\n\n### No participants who just say hello\n\nYou know the type, right? Says hello at the start, listens quietly for an hour and then says goodbye at the end. These are the people you need to send notes to instead! Meetings are for having a conversation.\n\n## The extra mile\nIf you want to go the extra mile, here are some additional tips.\n\n### Summarize actionable items in notes\n\nBesides raw notes or a meeting log, have an \"outcomes\" or \"next steps\" section, where you separately list what you came away from the meeting with. These can be decisions, conclusions, questions the group landed on or actual next actions the group can take.\n\n### Schedule in advance\n\nSet meetings at least one workday ahead. Let people prepare (since you've also shared the topics you'll discuss, right?). \n\n### Keep all meeting notes in a central place\n\nCloud storage, company servers, GitHub repository, it doesn't matter. But keep all notes from all meetings in one place where the whole team can access them. This will allow members to check for information, mine for tasks to do and settle disagreements about what we really agreed on in a blink.","lastmodified":"2023-03-03T12:07:59.412715051Z","tags":null},"/notes/Job-to-be-done":{"title":"Job-to-be-done","content":"\nInstead of focusing on the tool/product, ask \"what does the user want to achieve?\"\n\nSimple summary: [Job-to-be-done — Gordon Brander](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/job-to-be-done/)\n\n\u003e A classic illustration of job-to-be-done thinking is [Theodore Levitt's](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Levitt)quip that **people don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole**.\n\n[Know Your Customers’ “Jobs to Be Done”](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)","lastmodified":"2023-03-03T12:07:59.412715051Z","tags":null},"/notes/Kanban":{"title":"Kanban","content":"The Kanban method is a workflow/process system.\n\n# Kanban principles \u0026 practices\n## Principles\n- Change management principles\n\t1.

Every morning the farmer comes, brings food and fresh water for the turkeys, changes the hay and even pets a few of them. Every morning the Scientist Turkey notes another day of this happening.

This way you can get more value out of something that would otherwise have been discarded after the main goal of the original project was reached. You've already invested the effort and money to create or obtain this thing, so might as well use it as far as it will go.\n\n\u003eWhen you’ve created something of value, there’s probably a lot of hidden infrastructure propping it up from below the surface. And it’s quite likely that someone else who’s trying to create a similar product would pay good money to reuse the infrastructure you’ve built. That infrastructure doesn’t cost you anything more to produce — you’ve already built it — so you just need to identify it, haul it up to the surface, package it up, and ship it out.\n\u003e**Source: [🐃 Use every part of the buffalo - by Neel Mehta](https://namehta.substack.com/p/every-part-of-the-buffalo)**\n\nAnother way to interpret this approach is to take things that are practically free and use them. In this interpretation the \"leftover buffalo parts\" are just lying around, free for the taking. The buffalo is already killed and butchered, so there's no extra effort needed to get the remaining parts.\n\nThis approach is related to the [[Sell pickaxes, don't dig for gold|pickaxe model]] - when you've built a product and then you sell the tools you used, you're basically going one level down and selling tools to other people building products. They're also both ways to [[Work smart, not hard]].\n\nExamples:\n- B-roll filmed for one video can be reused in others\n- Free plans of software tools to build business processes or even products on top of\n- Selling tools built to create a product as products of their own \n\t(eg. a custom Wordpress plugin you made for your own website, business document templates, process templates for other companies in the same industry)\n- Online training product based on what you learned for your own business\n- Cashback from a large business purchase\n- Free gifts from a partner as free gifts for other partners or employees\n- A process you built up for one part of the business to be used for other parts as well\n\n\n## Fleeting notes\nA bit of a racist metaphor, relying on the idea of the [[Noble savage]].
