{"/":{"title":"ðŸª´ The Grove","content":"\n## Welcome to [[notes/The Grove]]!\n\nI am Robert Fono and this is a collection of notes on various topics I'm exploring.\n\nThis site is [[notes/Topographical website|topographical, not chronological]]. This means that you won't find a blog roll or feed. You are, instead, encouraged to meander and explore, following links, jumping from page to page.\n\n## On evolving notes\n\nAcross the site you will find notes marked with various states of development. Some notes are newer, some I only had some vague initial thoughts about. Other notes I might have returned to, added new sources, phrased things better, or had new thoughts on them. Tags like `rough`, `growing` and `developed` will mark how evolved and \"complete\" I feel a note is.\n\nSome notes might have preambles stating the [[notes/Assumed audience]] and [[notes/Epistemic status]] of the note. These are intended to provide context on my thinking around the note.\n\n## Actively tended\n\nCurrently I'm regularly coming back to these notes:\n \n- [[notes/The Manager's Toolkit]]\n- [[notes/Technology only matters when it enables new UX]]\n\n---\n\n*You can also jump over to my main site, [secondthought.media](https://secondthought.media).*\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-21T13:05:36.657481228Z","tags":null},"/notes/Assumed-audience":{"title":"Assumed audience","content":"\n\n## Links\n[Assumed Audiences](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-21T13:05:36.657481228Z","tags":null},"/notes/Epistemic-status":{"title":"Epistemic status","content":"\n\n## Links\n\n[Epistemic statuses are lazy, and that is a good thing | devonzuegel.com](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-21T13:05:36.657481228Z","tags":null},"/notes/Good-Meetings":{"title":"Good Meetings","content":"\nWhat makes a good meeting?

(and when twitter seemed in danger, only then did ppl start to look at mastodon, not because it's federated, but because it's like twitter. federation is under the hood and most ppl don't care)\nbitcoin is wire transfers, but distributed. but we do have wire transfers, they are cheaper, more reliable and widely accepted. besides the novelty factor (and later speculation), why would any person switch to bitcoin? well, they didn't.\n\nthe point is: the deciding factor in what people use en masse is UX, not technology. technology is only successful when it enables new kinds of UX. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-21T13:05:36.657481228Z","tags":null},"/notes/Technology-technique-methodology-method-practice":{"title":"Technology, technique, methodology, method, practice","content":"\nrelated concepts. what are they, how do they differ and why is that difference significant?\n\ncould be similar to [[strategy vs tactic]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-21T13:05:36.657481228Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Grove":{"title":"The Grove","content":"\nCan be called a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).\n\n## What is it?\n\n- [[notes/Topographical website|topographical]], not chronological\n- perpetually in progress, iterative\n- attempt to [[notes/Learn in public]]\n\n\nNote types/roles/statuses:\n\n- #rough\n- #growing\n- #developed\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-21T13:05:36.657481228Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Managers-Toolkit":{"title":"The Manager's Toolkit","content":"\n## What are a managers tools?\n\nmanagers work with people, so a manager's tools are people focused.\n\nmetaphor:\n\u003e a hammer is a carpenter's tool. the handle is how the carpenter interacts with it, the head is how the tool does what it's for. for a manager the handle is the apps one uses day to day, but that's not what matters. the hammer's head for a manager is the methods, frameworks, approaches for changing people's behavior. a hammer head without a handle can still drive a nail. it won't be a great experience for the carpenter, but it can be done. similarly, the tools are what matter here, the \"handles\", the apps and stuff are just there to make the experience easier for the user, but not what one should focus on if they want an effective tool.\n\nThis is to say, by tools I don't mean apps, services or elaborate spreadsheets.
