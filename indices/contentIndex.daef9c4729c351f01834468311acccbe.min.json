{"/":{"title":"ðŸª´ The Grove","content":"\n## Welcome to [[notes/The Grove]]!\n\nI am Robert Fono and this is a collection of notes on various topics I'm exploring.\n\nThis site is [[notes/Topographical website|topographical, not chronological]]. This means that you won't find a blog roll or feed. You are, instead, encouraged to meander and explore, following links, jumping from page to page.\n\n## On evolving notes\n\nAcross the site you will find notes marked with various states of development. Some notes are newer, some I only had some vague initial thoughts about. Other notes I might have returned to, added new sources, phrased things better, or had new thoughts on them. Tags like `rough`, `growing` and `developed` will mark how evolved and \"complete\" I feel a note is.\n\nSome notes might have preambles stating the [[notes/Assumed audience]] and [[notes/Epistemic status]] of the note. These are intended to provide context on my thinking around the note.\n\n## Actively tended\n\nCurrently I'm regularly coming back to these notes:\n\n- [[notes/The Manager's Toolkit]]\n\n---\n\n*You can also jump over to my main site, [secondthought.media](https://secondthought.media).*\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-19T22:33:00.65482891Z","tags":null},"/notes/Assumed-audience":{"title":"Assumed audience","content":"\n\n## Links\n[Assumed Audiences](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-19T22:33:00.65482891Z","tags":null},"/notes/Epistemic-status":{"title":"Epistemic status","content":"\n\n## Links\n\n[Epistemic statuses are lazy, and that is a good thing | devonzuegel.com](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-19T22:33:00.65482891Z","tags":null},"/notes/Good-Meetings":{"title":"Good Meetings","content":"\nWhat makes a good meeting?
