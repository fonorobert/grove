# Sell pickaxes, don't dig for gold

The Pickaxe Model is a good example of [[Work smart, not hard|working smart, not hard]]. The metaphor is of the Gold Rush: instead of doing the hard and risky work of mining for gold, be the person selling pickaxes to all the gold miners. Whether or not they find gold, you still made money. It's a more stable revenue stream than hoping to strike gold and you are not betting on an individual miner or an individual mine, but on the system overall, which is a much safer bet.

The Pickaxe Model can be a version of [[Use every part of the buffalo|using every part of the buffalo]]. Amazon AWS is a good example: they built the software to run Amazon, now they're selling that software and infrastructure to other companies building their own products. AWS makes a ton of money from all sorts of industries without Amazon needing to directly sell in those industries.

Good examples of the pickaxe model:
- selling GPUs to crypto miners
- the Adobe Creative Suite (profits whether individual designers make it or not)
- actual hardware store near construction sites
- rent cars to Uber drivers instead of running a taxi company

## Fleeting notes
This works best on new industries or situations where customers are looking for a quick, simple or cheap solution, or there is scarcity of tools. In these situations you don't have to worry much about competition and customers taking their time to even invest in building their own tools.
