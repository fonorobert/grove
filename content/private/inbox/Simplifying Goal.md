# Simplifying Goal

A Simplifying Goal is an overarching goal or mission that is designed to focus activities and reduce the number of options, making decisions simpler.

Can be personal or team goal, work both ways.

By using a Simplifying Goal, one can make decision making obvious and thus easy. If my personal goal is to gain financial stability, then all the possible things I could do that don't contribute to that (or even cost money) are out of the picture. If my goal is to become a confident artist, then creative activities or a creative job is a clear choice over a more financially stable one.

## General principles
- One goal at a time
- Actually use the goal, otherwise it does nothing
