# Use every part of the buffalo
The practice generally attributed to Native North-American groups is that when they killed a buffalo, they didn't just eat the meat, they also used the hide for clothes or shelter, the bones to make tools out of, etc.

As a business [[Heuristic|heuristic]] using every part of the buffalo means to take elements of a project and use them elsewhere, not just the specific project they were needed for. This way you can get more value out of something that would otherwise have been discarded after the main goal of the original project was reached. You've already invested the effort and money to create or obtain this thing, so might as well use it as far as it will go.

>When you‚Äôve created something of value, there‚Äôs probably a lot of hidden infrastructure propping it up from below the surface. And it‚Äôs quite likely that someone else who‚Äôs trying to create a similar product would pay good money to reuse the infrastructure you‚Äôve built. That infrastructure doesn‚Äôt cost you anything more to produce ‚Äî you‚Äôve already built it ‚Äî so you just need to identify it, haul it up to the surface, package it up, and ship it out.

Another way to interpret this approach is to take things that are practically free and use them. In this interpretation the "leftover buffalo parts" are just lying around, free for the taking. The buffalo is already killed and butchered, so there's no extra effort needed to get the remaining parts.

This approach is related to the [[Sell pickaxes, don't dig for gold|pickaxe model]] - when you've built a product and then you sell the tools you used, you're basically going one level down and selling tools to other people building products. They're also both ways to [[Work smart, not hard]].

Examples:
- B-roll filmed for one video can be reused in others
- Free plans of software tools to build business processes or even products on top of
- Selling tools built to create a product as products of their own 
	(eg. a custom Wordpress plugin you made for your own website, business document templates, process templates for other companies in the same industry)
- Online training product based on what you learned for your own business
- Cashback from a large business purchase
- Free gifts from a partner as free gifts for other partners or employees
- A process you built up for one part of the business to be used for other parts as well


## Fleeting notes
A bit of a racist metaphor, relying on the idea of the [[Noble savage]]. Idea is solid though.
