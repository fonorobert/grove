# Trends are always about the past
Like turkeys on Thanksgiving day

## Turkey parable

Parable also raised in [[S B Antifragile - Nassim Taleb]]:
Suppose there is a Scientist Turkey in the turkey coop, who is trying to create a model of turkey life for all the other turkeys. Every morning the farmer comes, brings food and fresh water for the turkeys, changes the hay and even pets a few of them. Every morning the Scientist Turkey notes another day of this happening. After months of this going on, the Scientist Turkey gets up and gives a lecture to all the other turkeys about how his data shows that life is stable and predictable and the farmer is the source of their abundance, that he considers it his job to make the turkeys comfortable and happy. His talk is cut short by the farmer entering with a big knife and a sack. It is the day before Thanksgiving and he's come to butcher the turkeys to be sold.

## General idea

Past trends only definitively say something about the past. We can't expect trends to continue forever, because often they don't and often they even can't (eg. [[Growth forever is impossible]]).

We also can't predict or understand the *purpose* or *goal* or *final outcome* of a system from past trends. We don't know if [[Monsters loom beyond the horizon]] (eg. [[great filters]] as the solution to [[Fermi's paradox]] or the universe could be a [[Dark forest theory|Dark Forest]]) and we know that [[Worst case scenarios happen]]
