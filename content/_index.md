## Welcome to [[notes/The Grove]]!

I am Robert Fono and this is a collection of notes on various topics I'm exploring.

This site is [[notes/Topographical website|topographical, not chronological]]. This means that you won't find a blog roll or feed. You are, instead, encouraged to meander and explore, following links, jumping from page to page.

## On evolving notes

Across the site you will find notes marked with various states of development. Some notes are newer, some I only had some vague initial thoughts about. Other notes I might have returned to, added new sources, phrased things better, or had new thoughts on them. Tags like `rough`, `growing` and `developed` will mark how evolved and "complete" I feel a note is.

Some notes might have preambles stating the [[notes/Assumed audience]] and [[notes/Epistemic status]] of the note. These are intended to provide context on my thinking around the note.

## Actively tended

Currently I'm regularly coming back to these notes:
