## Welcome!

I am Robert Fono of [secondthought.media](https://secondthought.media)and this is a collection of notes and patterns on various topics I'm exploring. You can view it as my bag of tricks, my mental toolkit, my collection of conceptual trinkets.

This site is [[notes/Topographical website|topographical, not chronological]]. This means that you won't find a blog roll or feed. You are, instead, encouraged to meander and explore, following links, jumping from page to page.

## On evolving notes

Across the site you will find notes that are newer, ones I only had some vague initial thoughts about. Other notes I might have returned to, added new sources, phrased things better, or had new thoughts on them. Keep this in mind. If a note seems incomplete, it likely is.

## Actively tended

Currently I'm regularly coming back to these notes:
