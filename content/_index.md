## Welcome!

I am Robert Fono and this is a collection of notes on various topics I'm exploring.

This site is [[notes/Topographical website|topographical, not chronological]]. This means that you won't find a blog roll or feed. You are, instead, encouraged to meander and explore, following links, jumping from page to page.

## On evolving notes

Across the site you will find notes that are newer, some I only had some vague initial thoughts about. Other notes I might have returned to, added new sources, phrased things better, or had new thoughts on them.

## Actively tended

Currently I'm regularly coming back to these notes:
