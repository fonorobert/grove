title: "Pattern of Life"
---
Surveillance term, meaning a baseline of normal daily habits and patterns of a person or community.Eg. starbucks is full every morning between 8-9, by 9:30 it's empty. I leave homebetween 9:30-10:30 on work mornings, then spend another 10 min smoking by the scooter efore leaving

POL establishes a baseline for two purposes:
- to notice when sg changes (normal pattern is broken in some way)
- to work around the pattern (break in when target is out, schedule a sensitive meeting to a time when nobody's going to be at starbucks, blens in locally, move your car in the morning when everyone does to not stand out as the person still home at 11)
