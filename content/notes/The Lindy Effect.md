[Lindy effect — Gordon Brander](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/lindy-effect/)

> The Lindy Effect posits that the lifespan of an idea is about 2x as long as it is old. If the story of [Beowulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) has been told for about 1000 years, we can expect it to be told for 1000 more.

The same very strongly goes for technologies. If we've been using writing for ~5000 years. Whatever remains of us in another 5000, it will use writing. Bricks, knives, paint, shoes, etc. The technologies that are the oldest already stood the test of time, they've been vetted by us and found fundamentally useful.

In technology, file formats are a good example of this. Formats like `.txt` and `.jpg` have been around so long and are being used so widely, that any new system needs to be able to use them. So no matter the platform or the OS, plaintext, jpg compressed images, these will work on it.
