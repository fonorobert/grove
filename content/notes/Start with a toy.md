Stole this idea from [Start with a toy â€”            Gordon Brander](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/start-with-a-toy/)

Instead of starting with a "product", start with what might be considered a toy: fun, simple, not particularly productive.

Two reasons: 
- experiment and figure out what the core of the idea is without investing a ton of time
- anything that can be a "product" is in a space already explored and defined by others. a toy can be something new
