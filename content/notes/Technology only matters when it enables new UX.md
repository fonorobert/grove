title: "Technology only matters when it enables new UX"

caveats: this is most applicable to personal computing systems. medicine, industry, etc doesn't put such a premium on UX.

decentralized, distributed protocols are a great idea in principle.

but you can't build a new protocol, then build a replica of existing old-protocol apps on top, claim the main benefit is that it's now distributed and expect ppl to use it.

normal people (even most technical ppl) may be insterested in the pricniple, but a theoretical benefit won't move them to the new system.

you need unique apps that can *only* be built on top of the new protocol. something where the USP of the app directly derives from the new layer or architecture. "twitter but distributed" is not a USP. "notion, but on IPFS" is not a USP.

protocols and apps are built by different people usually. build your protocol, build your reference implementation. but you (or someone else) will have to build something new on top of the protocol, or it won't matter.

if you don't have at least one usecase where the new protocol enables some behavior or operation for the user that they couldn't do on the old protocol, your protocol doesn't matter. it might be cool, it might be better, but unless people are highly motivated to use it (or are forced to a la HTTPS), they simply won't.

anytype is notion but on ipfs. but we already have notion.
mastodon is twitter, but federated. but we already have twitter. (and when twitter seemed in danger, only then did ppl start to look at mastodon, not because it's federated, but because it's like twitter. federation is under the hood and most ppl don't care)
bitcoin is wire transfers, but distributed. but we do have wire transfers, they are cheaper, more reliable and widely accepted. besides the novelty factor (and later speculation), why would any person switch to bitcoin? well, they didn't.

the point is: the deciding factor in what people use en masse is UX, not technology. technology is only successful when it enables new kinds of UX.
