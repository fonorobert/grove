## 80% manager

few simple techniques make most of the difference because of [[notes/The 80-20 Rule]]

## What are a managers tools?

managers work with people, so a manager's tools are people focused.

metaphor:
> a hammer is a carpenter's tool. the handle is how the carpenter interacts with it, the head is how the tool does what it's for. for a manager the handle is the apps one uses day to day, but that's not what matters. the hammer's head for a manager is the methods, frameworks, approaches for changing people's behavior. a hammer head without a handle can still drive a nail. it won't be a great experience for the carpenter, but it can be done. similarly, the tools are what matter here, the "handles", the apps and stuff are just there to make the experience easier for the user, but not what one should focus on if they want an effective tool.

This is to say, by tools I don't mean apps, services or elaborate spreadsheets. I mean methods and practices.
