The Kanban method is a workflow/process system.

# Kanban principles & practices
## Principles
- Change management principles
	1. Start with what you do now
	2. Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
	3. Encourage acts of leadership at all levels
- Service delivery principles
	1. Focus on customer's needs and expectations
	2. Manage the work
	3. Regularly review the network of services

## Practices
1. Visualize the workflow
2. Limit Work In Progress (WIP)
3. Manage flow, not people
4. Make process policies explicit
5. Feedback loops
6. Improve collaboratively


# Basic Kanban rules
- Visualize work
- Track status of items
- Limit WIP (Work In Progress)
- Pull, not push
- Make process rules explicit

# Personal Kanban

Without a team, a lot of the principles make no sense or are not needed.

The two important ones that remain:
- Visualize work
- Limit WIP

# Visual setup & workflow

## Kanban board

## Flow - pull

- Fill tasks into backlog
- Team members pull from backlog into "In progress"
- Every column pulls from the previous one (as opposed to columns pushing to next)
- WIP limits honored! If column is at limit, can't pull into it!

## Meetings

- Replenish meetings (fill backlog, prioritize, etc.)
- Kanban meeting/daily standup (quick checkin, pull, etc.)
- Flow review (where are bottlenecks, process changes, etc.)
- Retrospective (regular post mortem/debrief, learning points, etc.)
