## What are meetings for?
Meetings are one of the most frequently used management tool, but that doesn't mean they're always used for the right reason or ran in the right ways. Meetings should be about getting people together to talk through a disagreement, make decisions, plan together or talk through existing plans. That last one is especially important, having a "do we still agree?" meeting is a great way to surface concerns before it's too late. 

## Key elements of a good meeting

### Goals - what are we even doing here?

Why are we having this meeting? What are we trying to accomplish? This is also a great point to decide whether a meeting is the right tool to accomplish this goal. Could this be done over Slack or email instead?

### Agenda - like, have one!

What topics are we going to discuss? A simple list is fine, the point is to let everyone prepare. Agendas are great for keeping a meeting on track as well. Is what we're talking about on the agenda? If not, should it be, or should we just get back on topic?
You should share the agenda **before** the meeting. Some of the worst meetings happen because nobody knew what they were showing up to discuss.

### Notes - take'em, share'em!

Take notes. Simple, isn't it? You may find this difficult, maybe you're trying to write down every turn of the discussion, that can certainly be too much. You can start by focusing on just the outcomes however, after all this is the important bit to remember later. What did we agree on? What did we decide? What conclusions did we come to?

One more thing: **share your notes** after the meeting. Every participant should receive a meeting log of some sort. Yes they may have taken their own notes, but this way there is a shared set of notes that everyone sees and can refer back to.

You can also share notes with stakeholders that you'd otherwise invite to the meeting. If they'd just be there to "stay in the loop", a set of notes is a better way to keep them up-to-date.


## Rules for a good meeting

At the very minimum keep yourself to these rules and you'll be 80% of the way to having good meetings.

### No agenda - no meeting!

If you don't know beforehand what you'll be talking about, you're not ready to talk yet. "Figuring out what we should talk about" is a perfectly valid meeting topic. Once you've figured that out, you can schedule a new meeting for discussing the topics you came up with.
*Warning: don't let the "come up with topics" meeting turn into a "discuss topics" meeting. Let yourself and others prepare.*

If by the time the meeting is supposed to start you still didn't or couldn't share an agenda with participants, simply cancel the meeting$

### No participants who just say hello

You know the type, right? Says hello at the start, listens quietly for an hour and then says goodbye at the end. These are the people you need to send notes to instead! Meetings are for having a conversation.

## The extra mile
If you want to go the extra mile, here are some additional tips.

### Summarize actionable items in notes

Besides raw notes or a meeting log, have an "outcomes" or "next steps" section, where you separately list what you came away from the meeting with. These can be decisions, conclusions, questions the group landed on or actual next actions the group can take.

### Schedule in advance

Set meetings at least one workday ahead. Let people prepare (since you've also shared the topics you'll discuss, right?). 

### Keep all meeting notes in a central place

Cloud storage, company servers, GitHub repository, it doesn't matter. But keep all notes from all meetings in one place where the whole team can access them. This will allow members to check for information, mine for tasks to do and settle disagreements about what we really agreed on in a blink.
